Rob's Nasty Hacked Up Fork of DCCPi
==================================================================
This is a hacked up fork of DCCPi to work with the hardware build in trainCap.

The electrical function of the brake is inversed and the pin are software-definable.

Don't use this if you aren't using trainCap! Go use the real thing from https://github.com/hsanjuan/dccpi
